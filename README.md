First Place - Electron 2023

Our team addresses the problem with the following solutions:

Implementation at the barrier of a software that recognizes vehicle license plates.

Creation of a database that records the vehicles of all students residing in the campus and the professors, allowing them to enter the campus without interacting with a person. Resident students and professors will create an account on the website where they will enter their personal details and vehicle license plate numbers.

Visitors and non-residents of the campus will receive a receipt with a code to register on the website, through which they will make payments and always know the amount due.

Due to the limited number of parking spaces, we aim to delineate these spaces to avoid the problem of occupying more space than necessary, such as parking diagonally instead of parallel. This will effectively increase the number of parking spaces.

Each parking space will be equipped with a sensor to indicate whether it is occupied or not.

Creation of a database that will be updated in real-time with the number of free parking spaces in the campus, and this number will be displayed at the entrance.
